# 📚 School Project — Full Stack Web App

This is a full stack web application built as a school project. The original goal was to create a platform similar to Letterboxd, but for video games — a place where users could log games, write reviews, and keep track of their gaming backlog.
Unfortunately, the project didn’t fully come together the way I envisioned, but it still showcases some core functionality and full stack development concepts.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Spring Boot  
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Database:** Connected and integrated  
- **Hosting:** Web hosted and live  
- **Authentication:** User login and registration implemented

## 🛠 Features

- ✅ User authentication (signup/login)  
- ✅ Backend API built with Spring Boot  
- ✅ MySql integration  
- ✅ React frontend connected to backend  
- ✅ Web-hosted and accessible online  
- ⚠️ Some planned features are not yet implemented

## 📝 Notes

This project was developed for academic purposes and is a work-in-progress. While it showcases the foundation of a full stack application, some advanced features and polish are still pending.

              organize and prioritize your gaming wishlist. Add games, sort them
              by your own criteria, and never lose sight of what's next on your
              journey through gaming!

        <h3>Server Page</h3>
        <p>
          This page demonstrates the functionality of server-side code on our
          platform. Using technologies like Spring Boot, the server processes
          requests and dynamically generates content to deliver a seamless
          experience. To see the server-side logic in action,<a
            href="hello"
            target="_blank"
          >
            click here to go to the server-side page</a
          >
          and explore how data is rendered and managed behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <h3>Proposed Datbase</h3>
        <p>
          This table will store the essential information about games that users
          add to their backlog, allowing them to rate and review the games. The
          table will include fields for the game title, image URL, rating, and
          review, along with a foreign key linking back to the user who added
          the game.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            game_id - auto-incrementing primary key, unique identifier for each
            game.
          </li>
          <li>game_title - title of the game (unique within the table).</li>
          <li>image_url - URL to an image of the game (e.g., cover art).</li>
          <li>
            rating - a numerical rating for the game (nullable, between 0 and 5
            stars).
          </li>
          <li>
            review - a text field for the user to write their review (nullable).
          </li>
          <li>
            user_id - foreign key referencing the web_user_id from the web_user
            table, linking the game to the user who added it.
          </li>
          <li>
            added_to_backlog - a boolean indicating whether the game has been
            added to the user's backlog.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My Database Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I have no experience with relational databases like SQL. My only
          exposure has been to MongoDB, where I did some very light work, but
          I've never worked with the structure or queries of relational
          databases.
        </p>
        <h3>My Web Development Experience</h3>
        <p>
          My experience in web development is very amateur, consisting solely of
          client-side HTML and CSS rendering. I have no experience working with
          APIs or back-end development, and I'm just beginning to learn how
          everything fits together.
        </p>
        <h3>Hw1 Homepage</h3>
        <p>
          The biggest challenge I faced in Homework 1 was working with layouts
          and positioning. It took quite a bit of time to get everything
          properly aligned, and there were some frustrating moments trying to
          figure out the right structure.
